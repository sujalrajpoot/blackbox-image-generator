# Blackbox Image Generator

A Python library that provides a clean, object-oriented interface for generating images using the Blackbox AI API. This library encapsulates the complexity of API interactions and provides robust error handling for a seamless image generation experience.

## Features

- Object-oriented design with clean separation of concerns
- Comprehensive error handling with custom exceptions
- Type hints for better code maintainability and IDE support
- Flexible configuration options for API endpoints and headers
- Automatic image downloading and saving
- Status tracking through enumerated states

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sujalrajpoot/blackbox-image-generator.git
cd blackbox-image-generator
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install requests
```

## Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use the BlackboxImageGenerator:

```python
from blackbox_image_generator import BlackboxImageGenerator

# Initialize the generator
image_generator = BlackboxImageGenerator()

# Generate an image
try:
    prompt = "a beautiful mountain landscape at sunset"
    result = image_generator.generate_image(
        prompt=prompt,
        output_image_path="landscape.jpg"
    )
    print(result)  # Will print "Image Generated Successfully" on success
except BlackboxAPIError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

## Architecture

The library is built with the following components:

1. **Custom Exceptions**:
   - `BlackboxAPIError`: Base exception for all API-related errors
   - `ImageDownloadError`: Specific to image download failures
   - `ImageGenerationError`: Handles image generation failures
   - `StatusCodeError`: Manages unexpected HTTP status codes

2. **Status Tracking**:
   - `ImageGenerationStatus`: Enum class for tracking generation status
   - Provides clear status messages for different outcomes

3. **Abstract Base Class**:
   - `ImageGenerator`: Defines the interface for image generation
   - Allows for easy implementation of alternative image generation services

4. **Concrete Implementation**:
   - `BlackboxImageGenerator`: Implements the Blackbox API integration
   - Handles API communication, image downloading, and error management

## Error Handling

The library implements a comprehensive error handling system:

```python
try:
    result = image_generator.generate_image(prompt)
except ImageDownloadError as e:
    print(f"Failed to download image: {e}")
except ImageGenerationError as e:
    print(f"Failed to generate image: {e}")
except StatusCodeError as e:
    print(f"API request failed: {e}")
except BlackboxAPIError as e:
    print(f"General API error: {e}")
```
